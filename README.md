   Hi there, I'm Abuzar Tirmizi! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
   ### About Me
   Hello there! I'm Abuzar Tirmizi, a passionate student with a knack for learning and exploring new technologies. I completed my O-Level from The City School(PAF) and I'm currently pursuing my A-Level education privately. Recently, I delved into the world of programming with Python through Bano Qabil 2.0 and I'm eager to deepen my knowledge in this field.
   ### Skills
   - Programming: Python
   - Tools: Git, GitHub
   ### Projects
   - **Rock, Paper, Scissor Game:**
     This Python project implements a classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The game runs for three rounds, prompting the user to input their choice and playing against a randomly generated computer choice. Input errors are handled gracefully with user feedback for tie, win, or lose outcomes. The user's wins are tallied and displayed at the end of the three rounds.

   - **Ghost-Man Game:**
     Embark on an adventure with "Ghost-Man," an engaging Python game utilizing the Pygame library. Immerse yourself in a maze filled with challenges, represented by walls and dots. Maneuver the iconic Pac-Man character using arrow keys, navigating through the labyrinth to consume dots strategically placed throughout. The goal is to devour all the dots. The graphical user interface provides a visually appealing experience, enhancing the classic Pac-Man gameplay. Test your skills and enjoy the thrill of Ghost Man's journey through the pixelated maze!
   ### What's Next?
   I'm continuously expanding my knowledge and skills. Here's what's on my learning roadmap:
   - Deepening my understanding of Python by exploring advanced topics such as data analysis, machine learning, and web development frameworks like Django and Flask.
